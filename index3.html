    <h1 style="color: darkblue; text-align: center;"><b>Romeo and Juliet</b></h1>
    <h5 style="color: darkblue;"> ACT 1</h5>
    <h5 style="color: darkblue;">PROLOGUE</h5>
    <p>Two  households, both alike in dignity,  <br>
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, <br>
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br>
    Where civil blood nakes civil hands unclean. <br>
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes <br>
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; <br>
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <br>
    Do with their death bury their parents' strife. <br>
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, <br>
    And the continuance of their parents' rage, <br> 
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, <br>
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; <br>
    The which if you with patient ears attend, <br>
    What here shall mass, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
    <h5 style="color: darkblue;">SCENE |. Verona. A public place.</h5>
    <p style="font-size: small; "><i>Enter SAMPSON and GEOGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i></p>
    <h5 style="color: darkblue;">SAMPSON</h5>
    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
    <h5 style="color: darkblue;">GREGORY</h5>
    <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
